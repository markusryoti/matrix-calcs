# Matrix calculator

Simple calculator app to do dot products with matrices. The implementation uses 2d pointer arrays, which is probably not the most sophisticated way since the array pointers can be all over the place. Should be able to accept both vectors and matrices.

Made for refreshing dot product calculation and playing around with C++.
